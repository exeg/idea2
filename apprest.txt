      Best Free Books

  1. Introduction

  The site that refers to the recognized books or books of new authors who
want to advertise themselves. The site on which the user can find a book
from the category he wants and can search for book he wants.
This site can have mobile application that reference the same database.
Mobile application can inform user about new books that are available.
Each book have rating system with reviews, links to publisher, image,
description, author information.
Users can rate books and post comments on books.	

  There is list of categories. There is rating for each book. There is
author information for each book.
Admin user can post new links to books with pictures and description.
Admin user can post author information. Admin user can delete old links.
Admin user can edit book information.
Ordinary users can post comments to the books they want. Also ordinary
users can rate book.

  2. Design and Implementation
  2.1 The REST API Specification

  With the help of the Loopback and Swagger services I have designed RestAPI for this project.

  As you can see on the screenshot all models are defined and all RestAPI operations are supported.
I used "Has Many" and "Belong To" relation types.  
Also I designed yaml file which you can import or upload to Swagger to explore my RestApi.
Please see links bellow for screenshot and yaml file:

 2.2 Front-end Architecture Design

I want to make interface where user can simply find the book he want with the
help of search system or categories menu. 

Basic concept of UI implemented in these mocks:
https://exeg.github.io/idea2/index.html
https://exeg.github.io/idea2/book.html

Navigation structure consists of primary menu and secondary menu.
Primary menu consists of general information, contact information and general
content of the catalog.
Secondary menu will consist mainly of book genres.
Please see my work flow diagram:

  2.3 Database Schemas, Design and Structure

 I have provided json files which represent schema and model relations from strongloop for my main models.

https://exeg.github.io/idea2/author.json
https://exeg.github.io/idea2/book.json
https://exeg.github.io/idea2/category.json
https://exeg.github.io/idea2/comment.json


 2.4 Communication

Loopback framework comunicate with MongoDB connector to extract data.
Front-End Application and Ionic mobile application comunicate with RestApi.

3. Conclusions

I am expecting to get fast and nice looking responsive design on my Web Application. 
I also expect to create nice ionic application and node.js server side application.
